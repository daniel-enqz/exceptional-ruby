I believe that if we take a look at any given line of code in a method, we can nearly always categorize it as serving one of the following roles:

1. Collecting input
2. Performing work
3. Delivering output
4. Handling failures

For intsance, lets take a look at the next example which actually looks everwhelming, its not ordered.....ðŸ¤”

## So how can we create readable code and tell a story with our methods?

#### 1. Performing the work:
> Let's start by defining "Performing the work", which is basically the core of every method.

**We need 3 essential steps to achieve this**:
1. Identifying the messages we want to send (in language as close to that of the problem domain as possible); then...
2. Determining the roles which make sense to receive those messages; and finally...
3. Bridging the gap between the roles we've identified and the objects which actually exist in the system.

I added an example in [this file](https://github.com/daniel-enqz/ruby-corners-100/blob/master/confident_ruby/lib/identifying-messages.md), please check it to undertsand this step better ðŸ‘Œ

#### 2. Collecting input:
> Now that we know how the core system of our methods can be structured, lets take a look at the actual first step of our list.

Collecting input isn't just about finding needed inputsâ€”it's about determining how lenient to be in accepting many types of input, and about whether to adapt the method's logic to suit the received collaborator types, or vice-versa.

### The goal is mapping the roles we need with the objects we have in our system.
I added more info in [this file](https://github.com/daniel-enqz/ruby-corners-100/tree/master/confident_ruby/lib/inputs.md), please check it to undertsand this step better ðŸ‘Œ

# Whow can we do a better input collection.
1.- Be sure to use built-in conversion protocols (#to_str, #to_i, #to_path, or #to_ary.)
