I believe that if we take a look at any given line of code in a method, we can nearly always categorize it as serving one of the following roles:

1. Collecting input
2. Performing work
3. Delivering output
4. Handling failures

For intsance, lets take a look at the next example which actually looks everwhelming, its not ordered.....ðŸ¤”

## So how can we create readable code and tell a story with our methods?

# 1. Performing the work:
> Let's start by defining "Performing the work", which is basically the core of every method.

**We need 3 essential steps to achieve this**:
1. Identifying the messages we want to send (in language as close to that of the problem domain as possible); then...
2. Determining the roles which make sense to receive those messages; and finally...
3. Bridging the gap between the roles we've identified and the objects which actually exist in the system.

I added an example in [this file](https://github.com/daniel-enqz/ruby-corners-100/blob/master/confident_ruby/lib/identifying-messages.md), please check it to undertsand this step better ðŸ‘Œ

# 2. Collecting input:
> Now that we know how the core system of our methods can be structured, lets take a look at the actual first step of our list.

Collecting input isn't just about finding needed inputsâ€”it's about determining how lenient to be in accepting many types of input, and about whether to adapt the method's logic to suit the received collaborator types, or vice-versa.

### The goal is mapping the roles we need with the objects we have in our system.
I added more info in [this file](https://github.com/daniel-enqz/ruby-corners-100/tree/master/confident_ruby/lib/inputs.md), please check it to undertsand this step better ðŸ‘Œ

## Whow can we do a better input collection?
1.- Be sure to use built-in conversion protocols (#to_str, #to_i, #to_path, or #to_ary.)
Here some cool examples:

I added some examples of the difference bewteen explicit and implict methods [here](https://github.com/daniel-enqz/ruby-corners-100/blob/master/confident_ruby/lib/built-in-methods.md).

> The key to working productively in an object-oriented language is to make the type system and polymorphic method dispatch do your work for you.

## Working with protocols

2.- Using our own built-in protocols.

> A well-documented protocol for making arbitrary objects convertible to our own types makes it possible to accept third-party objects as if they were "native".

- As you can see, in the next example we are only allowing `-`, can only be performed on instances of `Meters`.
- We are also crearing our own converison protocol .to_meters`
- We can now report changes in altitude without fear of mixed units. 
- We've ensured that any object which doesn't support the #to_meters protocol will trigger a NoMethodError.

```ruby

class Feet
  def to_meters
    Meters.new((value * 0.3048).round)
  end 
end


require 'forwardable' 

class Meters     
  extend Forwardable
  
  def_delegators :@value, :to_s, :to_int, :to_i

  def initialize(value) 
    @value = value
  end
  
  def to_meters 
    self
  end

  def -(other)
    self.class.new(value - other.to_meters.value)
  end

  protected
  
  attr_reader :value 
 end
 
 def report_altitude_change(current_altitude, previous_altitude) 
  change = current_altitude.to_meters - previous_altitude.to_meters
 end
```

3.- Use built-in conversion functions
- Integer()
- Array()


4.- Convert string type to classes

Imagine we are working on a Traffic Light system,where we can initialize new objects like:

```ruby
TrafficLight.new("green")
```
The problem is that we can ran into syntax errors, or non existent colors, etc. 
Also each color may have different behaviours, I added a code example here that show us how to take advantage of polymorphism and Dependency Inversion Principle.


5.- Reject unworkable values with preconditions
