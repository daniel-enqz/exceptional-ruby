## Cluster
> A cluster, in the context of computing, refers to a group of interconnected computers or servers that work together as a unified system. These computers, often referred to as nodes, collaborate to achieve a common goal, such as running applications, processing data, or providing services.

>  The cluster can be composed of physical machines, virtual machines (VMs), or a combination of both.
