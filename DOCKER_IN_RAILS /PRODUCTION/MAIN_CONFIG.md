# What is orchestation in docker
- Container orchestrators provide a platform for running and managing containerized applications, abstracting away low-level server details and automating tasks like container restarts and node failure recovery.
- Orchestrators enable smarter and resilient operations by understanding the desired state of the system, facilitating rolling updates, achieving zero-downtime deployments, and securely managing cluster state and communication.


## Cluster
> A cluster, in the context of computing, refers to a group of interconnected computers or servers that work together as a unified system. These computers, often referred to as nodes, collaborate to achieve a common goal, such as running applications, processing data, or providing services.

>  The cluster can be composed of physical machines, virtual machines (VMs), or a combination of both.
