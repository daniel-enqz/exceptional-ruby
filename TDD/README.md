# TDD

Test-Driven Development is a development technique where you write a failing test and then create code to make that test pass. This process is sometimes called a red-green-refactor cycle with the failing tests being the "red" state, passing tests being the "green" state, and the refactoring step occurring after tests pass, where code can be confidently improved.
